In this subproject you should implement the repositories defined in the
subproject `domain`. Here you would put the code which interacts with the
database, for example.

For the purpose of this exercise, it suffices to create simple in-memory
implementations. For example, if you have a repository interface
`ShoppingListRepository` defined in the subproject `domain`, you would have a
corresponding implementation `InMemoryShoppingListRepository` here.
